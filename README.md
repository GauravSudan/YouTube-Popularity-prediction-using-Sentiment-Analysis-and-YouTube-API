# YouTube-Popularity-prediction-using-Sentiment-Analysis-and-YouTube-API
Classifying the category of any online content and predicting its popularity is an important task for a wide range of systems, from advertising to recommendation systems or making profit and earn money from online content. We here present a system for categorising a video into three broad categories namely ‘Health and Fitness’, ‘Travel and Education’ and ‘Personality Development’, and then we predict the future popularity of video using regression method based on views from the past. We prove the results of our system against a dataset containing views of 1500 videos on YouTube with a mean error of 0.8.
